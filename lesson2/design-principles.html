            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <h4>BYU Pathway Worldwide</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.byupathway.org">byupathway.org</a></p>
            <img src="images/byupathway2.jpg" alt="BYU Pathway"/>
            <p>Contrast is the practice of making design elements look different from each other 
                in order to make the important elements stand out, it also can be used to create 
                a focal point and establish visual interest by manipulating differences in color, 
                size, space and other factors. This is important to ensure that each element looks 
                different than others. This not only helps the user in differentiating between objects 
                but also helps in readability and navigation on the website. The proper application
                of this principle is applied in this website.</p>

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <h4>AirBnB</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com">airbnb.com</a></p>
            <img src="images/airbnb2.jpg" alt="AirBnB"/>
            <p>Hick's law, or the Hickâ€“Hyman law, named after British and American psychologists 
                William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, describes the time it takes for a person to make 
                a decision as a result of the possible choices: increasing the number of choices will 
                increase the decision time logarithmically. The AirBnB homepage design provide users with
                fewer options to what they want to do on the page.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-3">
            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <h4>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org">churchofjesuschrist.org</a></p>
            <img src="images/lds2.jpg" alt="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"/>
            <p>In graphic design, the principle of alignment refers to the way the different elements 
                in a design are lined up in relation to each other or to a particular part of the page.
                The church website demostrates the proper application of the design principle - alignment.</p>
